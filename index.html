about: >
    All of my original products were first created as Christmas gifts for my friends & family.
    I've gradually collected a nice set of hand tools, some small machinary and made a little workshop
    so it no longer takes a month to make each one.  A whole lot of love and craft still goes into
    each item just not quite so much blood, sweat and tears.

commissions: >
    I only ever make short runs of any of my products and I love to be inventive so
    I'm always excited about commisions.
    If you want something original, made well, email me.
    I'm more than happy to tailer a solution to a specific space in your
    house or any other requirement.
