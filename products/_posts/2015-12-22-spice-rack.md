description: |
    This rustic, hand-carved, oak spice-rack is held together with only pegs and a unique hinge joint at the handle.  It is double sided and intended to be portable, so that spices can be stored somewhere cool and dry and brought out for use.

    Due to its pegged and tenanted design, it is a pleasure to take to peices and re-asseble in order to post or to treat the wood.
