Hagatorn is the shopfront for the creative work of myself, Craig Chamberlain.  It is my ambition to design and make satisfying products, that beg to be touched, cherished and understood.

> Hagatorn is Anglo-Saxon for Hawthorn a plant also known as the 'Ladiesâ€™ Meat' or the 'Bread & Cheese' Tree.

As the root of the name may suggest, Hagatorn has one foot in the past, in folklore and in the archaic.  For me the important challange is how to bring this rich nostalgia, symbolism and material quality into a product that is of enduring purpose.  That is practical in construction and a pleasure use over many years.
